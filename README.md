<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Bendwell is a wellness platform aimed at those who are stuck at their desks for many hours at a time. Through the use of a custom trained pose detection model, users are able to stretch and recieve real time feedback, without having to leave their office, desk, or any other workspace they are at. Users can choose stretches to try from our pre-trained catalogue of stretches, or if interested, can make an account to build custom routines for targeting certain muscle groups, having a set break for stretching, or to accomate for different space requirments.

### Built With

Here is a list of the technology and frameworks used to build Bendwell.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Redux](https://reduc.js.org/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/)
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cs-2201-15/capstone
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application

```sh
npm run start
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

- To use the app, navigate to the stretches view to read more information about any of the stretches. Press 'try stretch' to run the stretch cam and try out the website's main feature yourself.
- If a user is interested in compiling more than one stretch together into a routine, either create an account or log in. After logging in, the user is able to create a new routine in the routines tab, and add individual stretches into that routine from the stretches tab. To run a routine, select any of the user's routines and press the 'start routine' button to run the stretch cam.
- To remove a stretch, press the 'remove' button in a specific routine, and similarly to remove an entire routine, press 'remove routine' from within the routines tab.
- To edit any information within the user's profile or any of the user-created routines, press the 'edit' button to edit any information availible.

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] Add Stretches through Teachable Machine trained model
- [x] Compile stretches into routines for users
- [x] Run stretches from catalogue through pose detection and classification feature - "Stretch Cam"
- [ ] Progressive Web App capability
- [ ] Incorporate social connections through sharing and rating routines

See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
